Linux kernel locks quick Reference

This chapter has introduced a substantial set of symbols for the management of concurrency.
The most important of these are summarized here:

1. semaphore:

	#include <asm/semaphore.h>
	The include file that defines semaphores and the operations on them.
	DECLARE_MUTEX(name);
	DECLARE_MUTEX_LOCKED(name);
	Two macros for declaring and initializing a semaphore used in mutual exclusion mode.

	void init_MUTEX(struct semaphore *sem);
	void init_MUTEX_LOCKED(struct semaphore *sem);
	These two functions can be used to initialize a semaphore at runtime.
	
	void down(struct semaphore *sem);
	int down_interruptible(struct semaphore *sem);
	int down_trylock(struct semaphore *sem);
	void up(struct semaphore *sem);
	Lock and unlock a semaphore. down puts the calling process into an uninterruptible sleep if need be; down_interruptible, instead, can be interrupted by a signal. down_trylock does not sleep; instead, it returns immediately if the semaphore is unavailable. Code that locks a semaphore must eventually unlock it with up.

	struct rw_semaphore;
	init_rwsem(struct rw_semaphore *sem);
	The reader/writer version of semaphores and the function that initializes it.
	
	void down_read(struct rw_semaphore *sem);
	int down_read_trylock(struct rw_semaphore *sem);
	void up_read(struct rw_semaphore *sem);
	Functions for obtaining and releasing read access to a reader/writer semaphore.
	
	void down_write(struct rw_semaphore *sem)
	int down_write_trylock(struct rw_semaphore *sem)
	void up_write(struct rw_semaphore *sem)
	void downgrade_write(struct rw_semaphore *sem)
	Functions for managing write access to a reader/writer semaphore.

2. completion:

	#include <linux/completion.h>
	DECLARE_COMPLETION(name);
	init_completion(struct completion *c);
	INIT_COMPLETION(struct completion c);
	The include file describing the Linux completion mechanism, and the normal methods for initializing completions. INIT_COMPLETION should be used only to reinitialize a completion that has been previously used.
	
	void wait_for_completion(struct completion *c);
	Wait for a completion event to be signalled.
	void complete(struct completion *c);
	void complete_all(struct completion *c);
	Signal a completion event. complete wakes, at most, one waiting thread, while complete_all wakes all waiters.
	
	void complete_and_exit(struct completion *c, long retval);
	Signals a completion event by calling complete and calls exit for the current thread.

3. spinlock:
	#include <linux/spinlock.h>
	spinlock_t lock = SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED;
	spin_lock_init(spinlock_t *lock);
	The include file defining the spinlock interface and the two ways of initializing locks.
	
	void spin_lock(spinlock_t *lock);
	void spin_lock_irqsave(spinlock_t *lock, unsigned long flags);
	void spin_lock_irq(spinlock_t *lock);
	void spin_lock_bh(spinlock_t *lock);
	The various ways of locking a spinlock and, possibly, disabling interrupts.
	
	int spin_trylock(spinlock_t *lock);
	int spin_trylock_bh(spinlock_t *lock);
	Nonspinning versions of the above functions; these return 0 in case of failure to obtain the lock, nonzero otherwise.
	
	void spin_unlock(spinlock_t *lock);
	void spin_unlock_irqrestore(spinlock_t *lock, unsigned long flags);
	void spin_unlock_irq(spinlock_t *lock);
	void spin_unlock_bh(spinlock_t *lock);
	The corresponding ways of releasing a spinlock.

4. read write lock:	
	rwlock_t lock = RW_LOCK_UNLOCKED
	rwlock_init(rwlock_t *lock);
	The two ways of initializing reader/writer locks.

	void read_lock(rwlock_t *lock);
	void read_lock_irqsave(rwlock_t *lock, unsigned long flags);
	void read_lock_irq(rwlock_t *lock);
	void read_lock_bh(rwlock_t *lock);
	Functions for obtaining read access to a reader/writer lock.
	
	void read_unlock(rwlock_t *lock);
	void read_unlock_irqrestore(rwlock_t *lock, unsigned long flags);
	void read_unlock_irq(rwlock_t *lock);
	void read_unlock_bh(rwlock_t *lock);
	Functions for releasing read access to a reader/writer spinlock.
	
	void write_lock(rwlock_t *lock);
	void write_lock_irqsave(rwlock_t *lock, unsigned long flags);
	void write_lock_irq(rwlock_t *lock);
	void write_lock_bh(rwlock_t *lock);
	Functions for obtaining write access to a reader/writer lock.
	
	void write_unlock(rwlock_t *lock);
	void write_unlock_irqrestore(rwlock_t *lock, unsigned long flags);
	void write_unlock_irq(rwlock_t *lock);
	void write_unlock_bh(rwlock_t *lock);
	Functions for releasing write access to a reader/writer spinlock.
5. wait queue
	
	/* 
	* This section is written by dongshan, maybe it is not correct, just according to my own understanding of
	* wait queue
	*/
	
	A wait queue is used for muti threads synchronisition. It can put a thread into sleep untill the condition
	is met, or it received a signal or timeout. Normally, one or more threads are waitting for a condition.
	
	There are two ways to declare a wait queue, satically or dynamically.
	
	static DECLARE_WAIT_QUEUE_HEAD(wq);	// statically declare a wait queue.
	
	wait_queue_head_t wq;	// dynamiclly decalare a wait queue
	init_wait_queue(&wq);
	
	// four macros implete to put threads into sleep
	wait_event(wq, condition);
	wait_event_interruptible(wq, condition);
	wait_event_timeout(wq, condition, timeout);
	wait_event_interruptible_timeout(wq, condition, timeout);
	
	These four macros will put threads into wait queue and sleep untill the condition becomes ture, or
	timeout meets. if the sleeping thread is intterupted by receiving signals, it returns a nonzero value;
	If timeout meets, it return a value 0 regardless of how the condition evaluates.
	
	// to wake up threads which are waitting on the wait queue
	void wake_up(wait_queue_head_t *wq);
	void wake_up_interruptible(wait_queue_head_t *wq);
